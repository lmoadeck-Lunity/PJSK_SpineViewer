# PJSK SpineViewer - 3rd Anniversary Chibis ONLY ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the PJSK SpineViewer project! This tool is designed **exclusively for viewing the 3rd Anniversary Chibis** from Project Sekai. If you are looking for the original v1 viewer, please visit [https://prsk-chibi-viewer.vercel.app/](https://prsk-chibi-viewer.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **GIF Exporting**: Easily export your chibi animations as GIFs.

## Acknowledgements
- This project is inspired by the original [v1 chibi viewer](https://prsk-chibi-viewer.vercel.app/), special thanks to the developers for their work.
- The viewer utilizes the [Spine Runtimes](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes) for rendering animations.
- The project is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, you will have to extract the chibi files from the game. The viewer is designed to work with the 3rd Anniversary Chibis, so ensure you have the correct files.

Skeleton JSON files can be found in [sekai.best](https://sekai.best/asset_viewer/area_sd/v2_sd_main/). Atlases can be exported via [sssekai](https://github.com/mos9527/sssekai). Huge props to their work!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
