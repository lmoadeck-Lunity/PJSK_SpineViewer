# PJSK SpineViewer - 3rd Anniversary Chibis ONLY ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the PJSK SpineViewer project! This tool is designed **exclusively for viewing the 3rd Anniversary Chibis** from Project Sekai. If you are looking for the original v1 viewer, please visit [https://prsk-chibi-viewer.vercel.app/](https://prsk-chibi-viewer.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **GIF Exporting**: Easily export your chibi animations as GIFs.

## Acknowledgements
- This project is inspired by the original [v1 chibi viewer](https://prsk-chibi-viewer.vercel.app/), special thanks to the developers for their work.
- The viewer utilizes the [Spine Runtimes](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes) for rendering animations.
- The project is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, you will have to extract the chibi files from the game. The viewer is designed to work with the 3rd Anniversary Chibis, so ensure you have the correct files.

Skeleton JSON files can be found in [sekai.best](https://sekai.best/asset_viewer/area_sd/v2_sd_main/). Atlases can be exported via [sssekai](https://github.com/mos9527/sssekai). Huge props to their work!
